* [Intro](https://medium.com/@jcbaey/what-is-apache-kafka-e9e73884e367), [Intro 2](https://medium.com/@patelharshali136/apache-kafka-tutorial-kafka-for-beginners-a58140cef84f),&#x20;
* [Kafka in a nutshell](https://medium.com/@aiven\_io/apache-kafka-in-a-nutshell-df10dfcc7dc) - But even these solutions came up short in some cases. For example, RabbitMQ stores messages in DRAM until the DRAM is completely consumed, at which point messages are written to disk, [severely impacting performance](https://blog.mavenhive.in/which-one-to-use-and-when-rabbitmq-vs-apache-kafka-7d5423301b58).

Also, the routing logic of AMQP can be fairly complicated as opposed to Apache Kafka. For instance, each consumer simply decides which messages to read in Kafka.

In addition to message routing simplicity, there are places where developers and DevOps staff prefer Apache Kafka for its high throughput, scalability, performance, and durability; although, developers still swear by all three systems for various reasons.

* [Apache Kafka Kafka](https://medium.com/develbyte/introduction-to-zookeeper-bcda7ef136cd) is a pub-sub messaging system. It uses Zookeeper to detect crashes, to implement topic discovery, and to maintain production and consumption state for topics.

### Programming Concepts

[Dependency injection](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/) - based on [SOLID](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#toc-single-responsibility-principle) the class should do one thing, so we are letting other classes create 3rd party/class objects for us instead of doing it internally, either by init passing or by injecting in runtime.\

### API GATEWAY

1. [what is](https://www.javatpoint.com/introduction-to-api-gateways)

### NGINX

1. [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/) is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
2. Cloudflare on [what is a reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/)
3. "[One advantage of using NGINX as an API gateway ](https://www.nginx.com/blog/deploying-nginx-plus-as-an-api-gateway-part-1/)is that it can perform that role while simultaneously acting as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and web server for existing HTTP traffic. If NGINX is already part of your application delivery stack then it is generally unnecessary to deploy a separate API gateway"
