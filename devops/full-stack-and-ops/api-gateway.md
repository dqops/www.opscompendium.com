# API Gateway

[what is](https://www.javatpoint.com/introduction-to-api-gateways)?

### NGINX

1. [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/) is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

3. "[One advantage of using NGINX as an API gateway ](https://www.nginx.com/blog/deploying-nginx-plus-as-an-api-gateway-part-1/)is that it can perform that role while simultaneously acting as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and web server for existing HTTP traffic. If NGINX is already part of your application delivery stack then it is generally unnecessary to deploy a separate API gateway"
